								     #Given a url pattern, Django uses url() to pick the right view and generate a page. That is, url--> view name. But sometimes, like when redirecting, you need to go in the reverse direction and give Django the name of a view, and Django generates the appropriate url. In other words, view name --> url. That is, reverse() (it's the reverse of the url function).
